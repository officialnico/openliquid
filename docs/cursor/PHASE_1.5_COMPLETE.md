## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. **ConsensusEngine** (`consensus/src/hotstuff/engine.rs`)
The main consensus orchestrator that integrates all Phase 1.1-1.4 components:

**Features:**
- ✅ Storage integration with persistent block/state storage
- ✅ State machine integration for transaction execution
- ✅ Vote collection and QC formation
- ✅ Three-chain commit rule with storage
- ✅ Leader election via Pacemaker
- ✅ Crash recovery from storage
- ✅ View change handling

**Key Methods:**
```rust
ConsensusEngine::new()          // Initialize engine with storage
start()                          // Start consensus with recovery
recover()                        // Restore from storage on startup
propose_block()                  // Leader creates new block
process_block()                  // Validate and store incoming block
on_receive_vote()                // Collect votes and form QCs
on_timeout()                     // Handle view changes
```

**Tests:** 13 engine-specific tests covering initialization, recovery, block processing, vote collection, and three-chain commits.

---

### 2. **SyncManager** (`consensus/src/sync/mod.rs`)
Block synchronization protocol for catching up with the network:

**Features:**
- ✅ Request missing blocks from peers
- ✅ Serve blocks to lagging peers
- ✅ Height tracking and sync detection
- ✅ Timeout handling for stalled sync
- ✅ Concurrent request management
- ✅ Configurable batch sizes

**Key Methods:**
```rust
SyncManager::new()               // Create sync manager
request_blocks()                 // Request block range from peers
handle_sync_response()           // Process received blocks
serve_blocks()                   // Serve blocks to requesting peer
sync_to_height()                 // Sync to target height
check_timeouts()                 // Detect stalled requests
```

**Tests:** 11 sync tests covering request/response, timeouts, height checking, and concurrent operations.

---

### 3. **CheckpointManager** (`consensus/src/checkpoint/mod.rs`)
Periodic state checkpointing for fast recovery:

**Features:**
- ✅ Create checkpoints at configurable intervals
- ✅ Restore from checkpoint on startup
- ✅ Automatic pruning of old checkpoints
- ✅ Checkpoint verification (state hash integrity)
- ✅ Metadata tracking (height, view, size)
- ✅ Configurable retention policy

**Key Methods:**
```rust
CheckpointManager::new()         // Create checkpoint manager
create_checkpoint()              // Take checkpoint at height
restore_from_checkpoint()        // Restore from saved checkpoint
should_checkpoint()              // Check if checkpoint needed
get_latest_checkpoint()          // Get most recent checkpoint
prune_checkpoints()              // Remove old checkpoints
```

**Tests:** 8 checkpoint tests covering creation, restoration, pruning, and verification.

## 🏗️ Architecture Integration

### Data Flow
```
Block Proposal → Storage → State Machine → Vote Collection → QC Formation → Commit → Checkpoint
        ↓                                                                            ↓
    Network Gossip ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← Recovery
```

### Recovery Flow
```
1. Startup → Load latest block from storage
2. Restore state machine to latest height
3. Rebuild block tree from storage
4. Resume consensus from recovered view
```

### Sync Flow
```
1. Detect peer at higher height
2. Request missing blocks (batched)
3. Validate and store received blocks
4. Apply blocks to state machine
5. Continue until caught up
```
