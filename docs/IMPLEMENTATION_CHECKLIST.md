1. Mark completed items with [x]
2. Update progress bars using █ (filled) and ░ (empty)
3. Calculate percentages based on completed checkboxes
4. Review weekly and adjust as needed

### **Progress Calculation:**
```
Phase Progress = (Completed Items / Total Items) × 100%
Overall Progress = Average of all phase progresses
```

### **Example:**
```
Phase 1: Consensus [███░░░░░░░] 30%  (12/40 items complete)
Phase 2: Core DEX  [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%   (0/26 items complete)
...
```
