**Specific Attack Vectors:**
```solidity
// Attack: Exploit transfer timing
tx1: EVM.transfer(SYSTEM_ADDR, 100)  // Assets disappear

## **Conclusion**

This risk assessment identifies **26 major risks** across 10 categories. Of these:

- **9 are Critical severity** (require immediate attention)
- **12 are High severity** (important for launch)
- **5 are Medium severity** (manageable with monitoring)

**Current Status:**
- **7 risks fully mitigated** (documented or implemented)
- **12 risks partially mitigated** (work in progress)
- **7 risks not yet addressed** (require immediate work)

**Overall Risk Level: HIGH** (acceptable for pre-launch, but requires P0 completion)

The OpenLiquid protocol has excellent technical foundations and comprehensive documentation. However, several critical risks remain unaddressed, particularly around:
1. Cryptographic key management
2. MEV mitigation
3. Economic sustainability
4. Formal verification

**Recommendation:** Address all P0 items before mainnet launch. The protocol should not go live until consensus safety is formally verified and incident response procedures are in place.
