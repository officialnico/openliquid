## Lessons Learned

1. **Reference Material Depth:** Academic papers and production systems contain critical implementation details not obvious from high-level descriptions

2. **Atomicity Tradeoffs:** The EVM/Core bridge model trades traditional atomicity for performance - requires careful documentation

3. **Mathematical Precision:** Market making requires exact formulas, not just conceptual descriptions

4. **Consensus Complexity:** HotStuff's advantages only become clear with detailed comparison to alternatives

5. **Developer Audience:** Need separate documents for consensus developers, application developers, and quant developers
